      <li><strong>Underlying Asset:</strong> The asset on which the value of a derivative is based, such as a stock, commodity, or currency.</li>
      <li><strong>Futures Contract:</strong> A contract that obligates the buyer to purchase an underlying asset at a specific price on a specific date in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>Options Contract:</strong> A contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a specific date in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>Call Option:</strong> An options contract that gives the buyer the right to buy an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a specific date in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>Put Option:</strong> An options contract that gives the buyer the right to sell an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a specific date in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>Strike Price:</strong> The price at which an underlying asset can be bought or sold under the terms of an options contract.</li>
      <li><strong>Premium:</strong> The price paid by the buyer for an options contract.</li>
      <li><strong>Expiration Date:</strong> The date on which an options contract expires and becomes invalid.</li>
      <li><strong>In-the-Money:</strong> An options contract that has intrinsic value, meaning that the strike price is favorable compared to the current market price of the underlying asset.</li>
      <li><strong>Out-of-the-Money:</strong> An options contract that has no intrinsic value, meaning that the strike price is unfavorable compared to the current market price of the underlying asset.</li>
      <li><strong>Hedging:</strong> The practice of using derivatives to offset the risk of an adverse price movement in an underlying asset.</li>
      <li><strong>Swaps:</strong> An agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows based on a notional amount, often used to manage interest rate or currency risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Forward Contract:</strong> A contract that obligates the buyer to purchase an underlying asset at a specific price on a specific date in the future, similar to a futures contract but not traded on an exchange.</li>
      <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> Assets pledged by a borrower to secure a loan or other obligation, often used in derivatives trading to manage counterparty risk.</li>
