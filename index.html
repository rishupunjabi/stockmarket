    <h1>Pivot Points</h1>
    <p> When it comes to technical analysis, one tool that traders often use is pivot points. 
        Pivot points are a popular tool for identifying potential support and resistance levels in the market. 
        There are different types of pivot points, including standard pivots and Camarilla pivots.
        

    
        <br> <strong>Standard Pivots</strong>Standard Pivots are calculated based on the high, low, and close of the previous trading session.
         The pivot point is the average of the high, low, and close, and then two levels of support and resistance are calculated above and below the pivot point. 
         The first level of support and resistance is based on the difference between the pivot point and the high or low of the previous session, while the second level is based on twice that difference.
    
    <br> <strong>Camarilla Pivots </strong>Camarilla Pivots on the other hand, are a bit more complex. They are calculated using a formula that takes into account the previous day's range and the opening price of the current trading day. The Camarilla pivot point is the average of the high, low, and close of the previous trading day. From there, several levels of support and resistance are calculated, with four levels above and below the pivot point.
    
    <br> The main advantage of using Camarilla pivots is that they tend to be more accurate and 
    provide tighter ranges for support and resistance levels. 
    However, they require more calculations than standard pivots, Camarilla pivots are a pivot point approach that includes a central range between the support and resistance levels. 
    They can be a useful tool for traders who want to identify potential consolidation zones and breakout points.
    
    <br>  
    <strong>Central Pivot Range (CPR)</strong>CPR indicator is used to identify trade price-level pivot points. Traders can place trades based on the various chart levels. It is very popular among traders due to its versatility and simplicity.

    It is very popular among traders because it is versatile and easy to understand. 
    The CPR indicator has three levels known as pivot points, with the top central pivot point being the highest and the bottom central pivot point being the lowest.
    
    
    To comprehend the CPR indicator, two fundamental concepts must be grasped. These are trading charts, candlestick patterns, and support and resistance levels. The former is used to identify critical price level breakout points. Support and resistance help traders identify the lowest and highest price levels that a stock can reach. It protects and limits the potential losses.
